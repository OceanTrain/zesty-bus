The desk and bed are on opposite sides, and what looks like tar covers the ceiling and bleeds down the walls. Behind you is the mirror and through it you see your real room, it's dim emergency lighting just barely illuminating your surroundings. Returning your attention to the inky black liquid, you see that it has now reached the floor and is oozing towards you.

As it gets closer, you back away step by step not taking your eyes off it. The light begins to fade and, glancing behind, you see that the liquid has begun to cover the mirror. In a split second, you make your decision and lunge through mirror, barely avoiding the reaching tendrils of darkness.

He has travelled such a long way and gone through so much to be on this train with me. But I wonder if we will be able to make it work. My father would be so angry if he were to ever find out, always warning me away from the 'lessers' of society. But Jack is different, he's so caring and sweet, always saying that with our love anything is possible.”

It is extremely powerful, and I advise you to use it with caution. I don’t know what you plan to do with this but ingesting more than half of this vial it will slow down a person's heart to a fatal degree. Please be careful.” The letter is signed by an apothecary.

ROOM [flooding_car] {
	<sounds/BGM/floodcarAmb1.mp3>
The room is pitch black. Large puddles of water cover the floor and the whole car smells of seawater. You begin to walk down the car, the wet sounds of your footsteps sounding too loud in the near silence. Out of the corner of your eye you see movement.

Whipping around, you brandish your candlestick and peer into the darkness. The wall beside you is wet and you can see the candlelight reflecting off it. Another flicker of movement and you spot what caught your eye; it's your own reflection.

The longer you look, the more you feel like you're missing something. Taking a few steps closer, you finally figure it out. Up close, you can see that your eyes are solid black. You tilt your head trying to get a better look but the movement of your reflection isn't quite right. Its face splits in an unnatural grin and you realize that it's not your reflection at all when it begins to speak…
